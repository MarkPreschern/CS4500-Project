class Referee(object):
    """
    PURPOSE:        This class implements a Referee for the game fish. It is purported to provide all the
                    functionality required for running a game from placements to moves and game end. It
                    reports game updates and the final report (at game end) to observers. The latter includes a list
                    of cheating and failing players, as well as a leader board of all rule-abiding players.

                    A cheating player is one that attempts to perform either an illegal placement (placing on an already
                    occupied tile or outside the bounds of the board) or an illegal move (moving via a path that
                    is unclear of holes or avatars, moving to an occupied tile, moving across corners or tiles that
                    are not accessible in a straight line across parallel hexagon edges, moving in-place, and moving
                    outside the bounds of the board). This determination is for placements is made using the State and
                    whereas the one for moves (or actions) is made using the GameTree. Both State and GameTree will
                    raise appropriate exceptions to indicate abnormal conditions should any occur.

                    A failing player is one that fails to return either a placement or an action. More specifically,
                    if a player returns an object of the wrong type (something that is not a Position for
                    get_placement or something that is not an Action for get_action), it is marked as failing.
                    Similarly, if a player takes takes more than PLAYER_TIMEOUT seconds to respond to the referee or
                    throws any exception(s), it is marked out as failing.

                    The referee will prompt the players for moves and placements by passing a deep copy of its
                    game state. This means that exogenous players will not be able to affect the state maintained
                    by the referee.

                    The referee will remove the cheating and failing players' avatars from the game and prevent them
                    from taking any more turns (that includes placing and moving).

    INTERPRETATION: The referee could best be described as the engine that runs a game of Fish. It receives
                    a list of IPlayer objects that is sorted by age and row and column dimensions of the board from
                    the tournament manager, sets up a homogeneous game board of the specified size and assigns each
                    player a color. The board the referee creates is homogeneous (has the same random number of fish on
                    each tile) and may have holes in it (see paragraph on "difficulty factor"). When signaled to kick
                    off the game (via start()) it then prompts each player for a placement by having them return a
                    Position object containing the row and column number they wish to place their avatar. After it
                    finishes prompting users for placements it prompts each movable player for an Action object
                    (made upÂ of a Position describing the place on the board the move is made from and another
                    describing the place the move is made to).

                    To setup the game board, the referee applies a "difficulty factor" - a Natural number that speaks to
                    the maximum number of Tiles the referee will try to remove. This factor is adjustable and can be
                    leveraged to make a game more challenging or less so. The referee will randomly pick the tiles to
                    remove and may even end up removing 0 tiles for a difficulty factor D > 0.

                    The referee also maintains a master copy of the game State which it updates throughout the course of
                    the game to reflect the players' positions, score etc.. Given the state's design, the current player
                    in it will always be unstuck (stuck players are automatically skipped) unless all players are stuck,
                    in which case the referee ends the game.

                    It also provides functionality that external observers can employ to follow the game. An
                    observer or tournament manager subscribe via `subscribe_game_updates` to receive an update with
                    the latest game state every time it changes (this happens whenever a player makes a placement or
                    move, or is kicked). They can also subscribe to an end game report via `subscribe_final_game_report`
                    to receive a copy of the final game report.

                    The final game report encompasses a list of the cheating players, a list of the failing
                    players and a list of dictionary objects sorted in decreasing order of score,
                    each object containing a rule-abiding player's name, color and score.

                    Here's an example of what the report may look like:

                    {
                        'cheating_players': [IPlayer],
                        'failing_players': [IPlayer],
                        'leaderboard': [
                            {'name': 'Winner', 'color': Color.BLACK, 'score': 99},
                            {'name': 'Runner-up', 'color': Color.WHITE, 'score': 40}
                        ]

                    }

                    Upon determining that no more moves can be made (by calling can_anyone_move() on the internal state)
                    , the referee ends the game and provides all players and subscribed observers with the final game
                    report.

                    At initialization, the referee is given a list of IPlayer objects with undefined colors (.color =
                    Color.UNDEFINED). After assigning colors, the referee creates a PlayerEntity for each object,
                    which contains the essential information needed for identification in the game (namely name,
                    color and placements). All other information pertaining to a player is scrapped. The referee
                    starts running the game (from the placement phase onwards) when start() is called on it (presumably
                    the tournament manager would call it to kick off the game).

                    Throughout the game, every time the internal game state is altered, the game tree is updated,
                    players are synchronized (by calling sync on them with the game state) and observers are notified
                    with a version of the latest one. This keeps all parties informed and the game tree up to date for
                    rule-checking.

    DEFINITIONS:    A losing player is one that does not obtain the largest number of fish in the game, or is one that
                    cheats or fails.

                    A winning player is one that obtains the largest number of fish in the game (and does not cheat).
                    There can be multiple winning players if multiple players obtain the same largest number of fish
                    in the game.
